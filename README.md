# Dynamic and Interactive Data Analysis Tool (DIDAT)

It integrates the existing R functions  with  reactive  functions  of  shiny  to  enable  analysts  to  explore  and acknowledge  all  aspects  of  the  data  without  having  to  write  any  R  scripts,  while providing  them  with  a  quicker  insight  into  the  underlying  structure  of  the  dataset.

The App makes it incredibly easy to analyze datasets by providing reactive bridge between variables selected as inputs and the results obtained (outputs).
